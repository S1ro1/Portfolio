        My name is Matej. I'm a student of bachelor's degree at the Faculty of
        Information technology at Brno University of Technology. I'm mostly
        interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence and data
        science. However I like computer science in general and I have explored
        many other technologies. Some other hobbies of mine are reading books,
        skiing or computer games.
